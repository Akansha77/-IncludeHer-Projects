It refers to the development and implementation of computer systems and machines that are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

It is designed to perform well in a specific area but lacks the ability to excel in other domains. General AI, on the other hand, refers to an AI system that has the capability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence across various tasks, similar to human intelligence.\n",

This involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions based on the given data. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns and relationships, mimicking the human brain's structure and functioning.\n",
